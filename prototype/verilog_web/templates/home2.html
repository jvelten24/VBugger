        <p><b>Principal Investigator:</b> Joshua Velten, Research Assistant, University of Michigan</p>
        <p><b>Co-investigator:</b> Hammad Ahmad, Ph.D. Student Computer Science and Engineering, University of Michigan</p>
        <p><b>Faculty Advisor:</b> Westley Weimer, Ph.D. Computer Science and Engineering, University of Michigan</p>
        <br>
        <p>You are invited to participate in a research study about measuring the efficacy of our Verilog debugging tool. The tool consists of circuit diagrams and highlighted implicated lines. We aim to improve the speed and accuracy of Verilog debugging through this tool.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you agree to be part of the research study, you will be asked to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete a questionnaire that assesses your level of experience with hardware design. (10 minutes)
            </li>
            <li>Sit in front of a computer and debug a set of stimuli (Verilog code containing bugs) with the assistance of our debugging tool. (40 minutes)
            </li>
            <li>
                Complete a post-questionnaire describing your answers. (5 minutes)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Benefits of the research:</b> We hope to use the results from this study to improve the quality of instruction and student satisfaction with undergraduate hardware design courses.
        </p>
        <p><b>Risks and discomforts:</b>To mitigate potential risk for reputational harm in the event of poor performance on the tasks is breached outside of the research record, we will de-identify all participant responses.
        </p>
        <p><b>Compensation:</b> You will receive a $25 gift card for your participation in the study. You will need to finish the study before you can enter an email address to redeem the gift card. </p>
        <p>Participating in this study is completely voluntary.  Even if you decide to participate now, you may change your mind and stop at any time.  You may choose not to complete either of the questionnaires or debugging exercises for any reason. If you decide to leave the study before it is finished, please tell one of the persons listed under contact information.</p>
        <p>Information collected in this project may be shared with other researchers, but we will not share any information that could identify you.</p>
        <p><b>Contact information:</b> If you have questions about this research study, please contact Joshua Velten (jvelten@umich.edu), Hammad Ahmad (hammada@umich.edu), or Westley Weimer (weimerw@umich.edu)</p>
        <p>As part of their review, the University of Michigan Health Sciences and Behavioral Sciences Institutional Review Board (IRB) has determined that this study is no more than minimal risk and exempt from on-going IRB oversight.
